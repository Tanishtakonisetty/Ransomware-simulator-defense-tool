# Ransomware-simulator-defense-tool
A controlled ransomware simulator that encrypts dummy files, along with a defense tool that detects unusual file changes and restores safe backups. This helps the users understand the risk without actual harm
## 📌 Overview
This project was conceptualized during an internal hackathon.  
It demonstrates how ransomware encrypts files and proposes a defense mechanism to detect and mitigate such attacks.  

## 🛠️ Features
- Simulates basic ransomware-like encryption using Python cryptography library.  
- Defense script to detect and stop encryption attempts.  
- PPT presentation explaining attack model and defense strategy.  

## 🚀 How to Run
1. Clone this repository.  
2. Open `ransomware_demo.py` for simulation.  
3. Open `defense_tool.py` for defense.  
4. View `Hackathon_Presentation.pdf` for project details.
